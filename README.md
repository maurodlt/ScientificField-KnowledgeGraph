# A Knowledge Graph representation of a Scientific Field

## To create Knowledge Graph

create_SciKGraph(documentsList, documentsNamesList, babelfy_key, language, distance_window, mergeIfFail)        


documentsList (list of files)= list of documents

documentsNamesList (list of strings)= list of the names of the documents in documentsList

babelfy_key (string)= babelfy key 

language (string)= 'EN'

distance_window (int) = value of distance to consider of concepts coocorrence

mergeIfFail (boolean) = If Babelfy fail (key problem) merged already babelfied texts?
